# mundos-e-devops
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with various DevOps tools and technologies. The focus is on learning and applying these tools through a lab-based approach.

## Part 1: Setting up the Environment

In the first part of the project, we will create a VM instance in Azure to serve as the base for our tasks. We will then proceed to deploy a Kubernetes Cluster using either Terraform or ekscli. Once the cluster is configured, we will integrate it with Azure DevOps and deploy an nginx container.

## Part 2: Deploying and Configuring Services

In the second part of the project, we will configure monitoring using the Elastic stack, FluentBit, and Kibana. We will also deploy Grafana and Prometheus.

## Optional: DNS and Certificates

There is an optional chapter that covers configuring Route 53, DNS, certificates, and giving a friendly URL to our site. This chapter is provided as a reference for future and personal projects, and can be skipped if desired.

## Getting started

To get started with this project, clone this repository and follow the instructions provided in the README files of each section.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, you should have a basic understanding of DevOps concepts and tools. Knowledge of Azure, Kubernetes, and containerization is also helpful.
